# qtvsc
using vscode to build and debug Qt application

qt version: 5.9.1 MinGW  

## build usage:  
+ build(debug):debug version(debug can be ignored)  
+ build release:release version  
+ build clean:delete build folder


# Note:  
Qt installing folder:C:\Qt\Qt5.5.1MGW, and the  
bin folder should be set as system environment  
if you wish to execute the app independently.

Should using mingw under Qt installing folder,   
which is in C:\Qt\Qt5.5.1MGW\Tools\mingw492_32 
So this should be set as system environment and
block the other installing mingw, as int my case  
C:\MinGW64
